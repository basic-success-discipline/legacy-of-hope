          <h1>The Guitar Initiative</h1>

          <p>The Guitar Initiative is a campaign to increase awareness and support for Nelson Mandela’s Legacy of Hope, through the medium of music. The Initiative has two main goals: to obtain musician and celebrity endorsements, and to produce ongoing recordings by artists to benefit the Children’s Hospital and its young patients. This campaign is supported by Gibson and managed by veteran music producer and executive producer of Legacy of Hope Concerts, Eric Gast.</p>

          <div class="guitarcopy1">
            <p>In the first phase of the Guitar Initiative, musicians and celebrities worldwide are signing guitars and pledging their support for Nelson Mandela’s vision of free and accessible healthcare for children all over the world. It has included, so far, artists such as The Crystal Method, members of the Grateful Dead, Steve Jones (Sex Pistols), Guns N Roses, members of Bob Marley’s Wailers, Blues Traveler,  Allman Brothers, Fishbone, Parliament Funkadellic, Robbie Robertson, Andy Frasier (Free), Nine Inch Nails, The Roots, Depeche Mode and Joseph Arthur.</p>

              <p>At the end of the campaign, these signed guitars will be displayed on the walls of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital, commemorating the significant role music and art played in building this historical state-of-the-art pediatric hospital. Selected guitars will be offered to the public during the upcoming Legacy of Hope fundraising campaigns. </p>
              <p>The Guitar Initiative also encompasses the larger vision of building a recording facility in the Children’s Hospital, where the recovering children will learn and practice skills related to music production. The children will learn to produce live performances given by visiting international musicians, as part of their recovery program, practical education, and to support the ongoing work of the hospital. </p>
              <p>The hospital recording facility is a radical concept that supports a wide range of goals: patient recovery, necessary skill training, and fundraising efforts that are required maintain a state-of-the-art hospital serving children from all socio-economic backgrounds. This ground-breaking Initiative is intended to be a template for future hospitals serving children around the world. </p>
