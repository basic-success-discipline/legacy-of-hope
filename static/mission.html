					<h1>Mr. Mandela's Legacy</h1>
					<p>The partnering of The Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Trust and The Legacy of Hope Foundation was expressly formed to aid in the creation and awareness of The Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital. The Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, groundbreaking is slated, 2015. The chosen site is at the Wits College of Education campus in Parktown adjacent to the Wits Medical School and Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital.</p>

					<p>The backbone of this campaign is based on the commitment and values of Mr. Nelson Mandela and our goal is to bring his dream of free and accessible healthcare for the children of Southern Africa to reality. In 2014, there will be a simulcast broadcast concert in the USA and South Africa which will bring forth the faces of Mr. Mandela's legacy and help to build a support and donor base for this much needed medical facility. This concert and campaign, with cerebral focus, centers on telling Mr. Mandela's story, as to create a credible and cogent footprint for the hospital's future donor/support base.</p>

					<h4>THIS MUCH NEEDED FACILITY WILL ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR DEDICATED CHILDREN’S HOSPITALS CURRENTLY SERVING THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.</h4>
					<p>A crucially needed pediatric hospital in South Africa is long overdue. The hospital will celebrate the legacy of Mr. Mandela and his love of children while advancing Mr. Mandela’s vision to future generations. This hospital, through its training and research will build human capacity and spread the ethos, values and approach of Mr. Mandela and entrench his values and culture throughout the world. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital will also be a turning point on how the world views under-served children by providing specialized pediatric care to all children, regardless of their inability to pay.</p>

					<p>To give you an idea of the imbalance, there are 14 pediatric hospitals serving California alone. As a result of this reality, many South African children simply wander ignored in their attempt to heal or survive and if these children do receive healthcare, they are thrown into comprehensive facilities that lack staff, medicine, equipment and critical pediatric expertise. In these facilities, children are unfortunately viewed as ‘little adults’ where the old and young suffer and heal, side-by-side.</p>

					<p>Statistics show that South Africa ranks 145th out of 197 countries in combating infant mortality, with an average of 56.62 deaths out of 1,000 births in the last four years.</p>

					<p>Ten years ago, Nelson Mandela enriched his living legacy by unfolding his dream of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital. A key figure in this dream is a person who literally stood next to Mr. Mandela as they consoled her son, Lindo, who died at the age of 5 from third degree burns. Sibongile ‘Bongi’ Mkhabela left the hospital without her son, but walked away with a shared vision by Nelson Mandela.</p>

					<p>"We suddenly saw the world of sick children and it was not kind, thoughtful or childlike - it needed change," explains Ms. Mkhabela. "Nelson Mandela has been a symbol of hope in my life. I consider it an honor to be a part of this event to further his legacy and bring aid to children in need."</p>

					<p>The shared knowledge of the realities of being incarcerated for protesting apartheid and thus for fighting for what you believe in, Mandela appointed Bongi Mkhabela CEO of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Trust. Since that time Mkhabela has directed the hospital’s feasibility stage, verification phase and with your help, the construction phase of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital.</p>
