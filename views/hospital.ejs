              <h1>The Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital</h1>
              <h3>HELP BUILD A DEDICATED SPECIALIST HOSPITAL FOR THE CHILDREN OF SOUTHERN AFRICA</h3>
              <p style="font-weight: 600;">THIS MUCH NEEDED FACILITY WILL ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR DEDICATED CHILDREN’S HOSPITALS CURRENTLY SERVING THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.</p>
              <p>To put all this in perspective, there are 12 children’s hospitals in the state of Florida.</p>
              <p>This new hospital, which will open in 2016, will celebrate the legacy of Mr. Mandela by improving the healthcare of Southern African children for generations to come. No child will be turned away due to inability to pay. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital will be also be a turning point for pediatric specialist training and research in the region. Many Southern African children are not receiving the critical care that they need for complex illnesses because there are not enough facilities or medical professionals dedicated to treating them. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital will also provide a holistic healing environment for the children, as well as room for reflection for parents. It is our collective effort that will ensure that we improve the lives of the future leaders of this world.</p>
