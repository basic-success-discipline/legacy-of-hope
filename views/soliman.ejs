       <!-- <h2>Middleweight Boxer Sam Soliman Named Legacy of Hope Ambassador</h2>  -->
      <p class="top"> In his prime, Nelson Mandela was a respected and light-footed boxer with an admiration for the physical and strategic demands placed on anyone who stepped in the ring. In this respect, Mandela would have loved the grace and ferocity of former IBF World Middleweight Champion, Sam Soliman.</p>
      </p>

      <p>Soliman, born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, welcomed the opportunity to align himself with the Legacy of Hope Foundation. As an ambassador for the Legacy of Hope Foundation, Soliman will help to bring Mr. Mandela’s wish for the 5th dedicated children’s hospital in Africa to fruition. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital is slated to open in 2016 in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

      <p>Sam Soliman was recently training in the Bronx in New York City this early October, preparing to defend his IBF middleweight crown against American Jermain ‘Bad Intentions’ Taylor in Biloxi, Mississippi. During training, Sam took valuable time out of his routine to accept an appointment and become an ambassador to the Legacy of Hope Foundation. Soliman was shocked by the statistic that only four children’s hospitals serve the entire continent of Africa with an estimated 450 million children in need of basic healthcare.</p>

      <p>The Legacy of Hope Foundation has a respectable cast of ambassadors and celebrities on their Honorary Board including fellow Australian film star Nicole Kidman. Legacy of Hope CEO, Eric Gast, welcomed Sam’s passion to the cause with open arms at a ceremony to formalize the ambassadorship. “Your positive role in the community is the embodiment of what the Legacy of Hope Foundation stands for.” Sam Soliman was humbled. “Any small thing I can do to assist Mr. Mandela’s dream to become a reality will make me happy.” As Sam’s first gesture as an ambassador, he autographed a pair of his IBF middleweight boxing gloves as well as a photograph which will be given away as part of the Legacy of Hope campaign.</p>
