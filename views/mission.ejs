        <h1>The Legacy of Hope</h1>
        <p>The Legacy of Hope Foundation was created to provide medical care and facilities for underserved children and communities around the world.</p>
        <p>The first initiative for Legacy of Hope is to help build the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Legacy of Hope, a collaboration between the music, philanthropy and entertainment communities, was formed to bring this much-needed medical facility to fruition.</p>
        <p>$100M is needed to build the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital.</p>
        <p>Join the Legacy of Hope team by making a donation and help empower Mr. Mandela’s Vision.</p>
