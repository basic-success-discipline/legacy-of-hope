{author: "Nelson Mandela", quote: "History will judge us by the difference we make in the everyday lives of children."},
{author: "Nelson Mandela", quote: "One way that we can build a better future for children is by empowering them through allowing them to speak up for themselves. Of course, we as adults have to guide them and to take ultimate responsibility but that is something quite different from patronizing them. The rights of children must, importantly, include the right to be themselves and to talk for themselves."},
{author: "Nelson Mandela", quote: "We understand and promote the notion that while children need to be guided they also have an entrenched right to be whatever they want to be and that they can achieve this only if they are given the space to dream and live out their dreams."},
{author: "Nelson Mandela", quote: "It always gives me great pleasure to be surrounded by the beautiful children of our land. Whenever I am with the energetic young people … I feel like a recharged battery, confident that our country can look forward to great things."},
{author: "Nelson Mandela", quote: "Together as a nation, we have the obligation to put sunshine into the hearts of our little ones. They are our precious possessions. They deserve what happiness life can offer."}
