Locations of files containing my work (the rest is mostly "external" dependencies and boilerplate):


app.js -- basic node webserver (uses express js for templating)

views/ -- contains ejs layout files for all views on the site

static/js/ -- contains most javascript files used in the site

static/css/ -- contains stylesheets

routes/routes.js -- handles url routing

routes/cmsgateway.js -- intended to be connected to a CMS like contentful, but never quite got to it
